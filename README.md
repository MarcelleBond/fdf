# FDF - Graphics Programming Basics with miniLibX

This project introduces you to the basics of graphics programming using the miniLibX library. You will learn how to place points in space, join them with segments, and observe the scene from a particular viewpoint. You will also discover the event-driven programming paradigm, where you will learn how to handle events like keyboard and mouse inputs.

## Introduction

This project is aimed at beginners who want to learn the basics of graphics programming using the miniLibX library. It will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of graphics programming, such as 2D and 3D graphics, and will provide you with a hands-on experience of working with graphics libraries.

## Getting Started

Before you can start using miniLibX, you will need to install it on your system. The installation instructions can be found in the [miniLibX repository](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux). Once you have installed miniLibX, you can start working on the project.

## Usage

The project consists of several modules, each of which covers a different aspect of graphics programming. To compile the modules, you need to run the following command in the terminal:

make

This will compile all the modules and generate the executable files. To run a module, you can use the following command:

./fdf

This will execute the corresponding module.

Note: You need to have miniLibX installed on your system before you can compile and run the modules. Please refer to the [miniLibX repository](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) for installation instructions.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you find any bugs or issues, please open an issue on the [project repository](https://github.com/MarcelleBond/fdf).
